Release-Notes for 0.5.13 (Fri Mar 26 19:46:44 CET 2004):
Okay, now I found out what the problem with the -m and -O function was. I
assumed (since I had read it somewhere) that the file size of vobs is max.
1GB. So when you want to write vts_01_4.vob you have to seek 3GB (1-3) into
the vts_01 stream. BUT, the sizes aren't 1GB, they are something less, not
standard (even change within one dvd). So now I get the size of every single
vob file and add them together for the vob I want to write.
Anyway, it _should_ work now.
There were also patches from Mark Prusinowski and Andrew Leiserson.

Release-Notes for 0.5.12 (Mon Mar  8 04:36:10 CET 2004):
There was a nice off-by-one error in the -m (mirror) function that caused
vobcopy to skip one block at the beginning of each new vob file.

Release-Notes for 0.5.11 (27-1-2004):
-O vts_01_4 -o - didn't write to stdout but rather to the files.
Also did info texts of vobcopy end up in stdout streams. Now all go
to stderr.
New option: -q (quiet): all info- and error-texts of vobcopy
end up in /tmp/vobcopy.bla instead if stderr.
Thanks to Dimitrios Apostolou!
		

Release-Notes for 0.5.10 (19-1-2004):
Stewart Andreason found a bug whereby if you wanted for instance
vts_02_4.vob you got vts_02_1.vob, always _1. This should work now.
Also some general code cleanup

Release-Notes for 0.5.9 (13-11-2003):
Florin Andrei send another spec file for rpm systems and the commands
to build the thing on rpm systems - integrated into the README. Thanks

Release-Notes for 0.5.9-pre2 (31-10-2003):
Ashley Martens found some stuff to clean up in my program. 
Was easy, yes, but she also fixes stuff and found a bug.

Release-Notes for 0.5.9-pre1 (9-9-2003):
-O can now accept parts of names. E.g. -O bup,ifo will copy all files
containing ifo and bup in their names. Several names have to be
comma-separated
On samba mounted files the renaming from .partial to normal didn't work,
hopefully fixed now

Release-Notes for 0.5.8 (28-8-2003):
The fast-switch (-F) has been enlarged so that you can now provide your own
factor behind it. Range is 1 to 64.
Added -O option to extract single files from the dvd. Expects as option the
name of the file to extract (video_ts.vob for example). Files can be listed
together with komma separation (video_ts.vob,vts_01_1.vob).
Added some stuff that the maintainer at fink added to vobcopy. Dunno if this
works so, but a beginning. This is for darwin and MacOSX.
Some fixes to solaris code.
Someone mentioned that files under unix are named differently if they are
still being written to than when they are finished. So now the files are
first called bla.vob.partial and later, if their size is ok, they get
renamed. Else they stay with .patial (later might come code to resume them -
later...)
Also another fix for mandrakes supermount. It *should* (start to) work now.

Release-Notes for 0.5.7 (14-3-2003):
Steve O'Hara-Smith provided a patch to speed up copying. This can now be 
toggled with -F (fast). Also, a bug discovered by Leif Sandstede is fixed 
(32 spaces were used as the name of the dvd if the dvd itself has no name).
Also, a string which was used to create the output dirs wasn't
zero-terminated and therefore resulted in garbled names sometimes.

Release-Notes for 0.5.6 (3-2-2003):
Davor Herga brought to my attention that some systems (he uses Mandrake) use
supermount where fstab and mtab entries are different. Normally they look
like this:
/dev/cdrom      /cdrom          iso9660 ro,user,noauto          0       0
There they look like this:
none /mnt/cdrom supermount ro,dev=/dev/hdc,fs=auto,--,iocharset=iso8859-1,codepage=850,umask=0 0 0
Vobcopy should now handle this.

Release-Notes for 0.5.5 (30-10-2002):
Erik Hovland made some extensive changes to get vobcopy to run on solaris.
Thanks a lot! Yay, another platform. 

Release-Notes for 0.5.4 (23-9-2002):
HIYAMA Takeshi fixed some things concerning FreeBSD again. The bugreporting
feature (-v -v , not that anybody is using it...) should now work on FreeBSD
too. Also he coded dvd device detection for FreeBSD so that the vobcopy call
on FreeBSD should also be only: vobcopy
;-)


Release-Notes for 0.5.3 (10-9-2002):
HIYAMA Takeshi fixed some things concerning FreeBSD ages ago. I was lazy,
sorry. He also patched vobcopy so that -t can now also be provided in
conjunction with -m to have vobcopy write the stuff to the dir with the
specified name.

Release-Notes for 0.5.2 (19-7-2002):
Bas van den Heuvel found a major bug in the mirror-code: Instead of seeking
though the whole title-vob I always restarted from the beginning which leads
to files where the content of VTS_01_1.VOB is exactly the same as
VTS_01_2.VOB and 3.VOB... I'm sorry, thinking error on my side. Robos

Release-Notes for 0.5.1 (16-7-2002):
Well, 0.5.0 was release a little to fast by me: some debug code was still inside
and -m spams to the console a lot. That's fixed now. Also, vobcopy now
outputs to name_of_dvd/VIDEO_TS/VTS... (in uppercase) since I learned that
this is necessary to burn it to dvd. Also the progression bars of -m and the
normal call where improved. There is now an experimental configure script
which tests the system if libdvdread is installed and if the system is
large-file ready. Don't know though how to handle this large-file support on
*bsd systems though...		

Release-Notes for 0.5.0 (13-7-2002):
Added the -m (--mirror option) to mirror the dvd/video_ts/ content to a dir 
created with the name of the dvd. The vobs are decrypted though.
Also long-options have been added (--Info) as a preparation for more options 
than letters in the alphabet ;-). Look in the man-page.
Some cleanup and bug-fix too. (Try to make vobcopy copy vobs to different dirs 
with the last dir being larger than 2 GB ...)

Release-Notes for 0.4.3 (25-4-2002):
HIYAMA Takeshi ported vobcopy to FreeBSD

Release-Notes for 0.4.2 (24-3-2002):
Devfs-enabled distribution users might have had problems, this has been fixed.
Also the output of vobcopy can now be written to stdout in order to pipe it to
some other program (-t stdout) or the file-name can be changed away from what 
the dvd specifies (-t name).

Release-Notes for 0.4.1 (19-2-2002):
A small bug was in 0.4.0, specific an include that isn't necessary met by a 
standard user install. But that wasn't mandatory anyhow ;-)
Also added two new options: -b and -e. Take a look into either the README, 
Changelog or man-page.
Also vobcopy now takes the title with the most chapters by default.

Release-Notes for 0.4.0 (15-2-2002):
I have now added something quite useful in my mind: the possibility to specify
additional directories where the data dump will be continued if there isn't 
enough free space in the dir provided behind -o. These additional dirs are 
named behind -1, -2, -3 and -4. It seems as if they have to be named *directly*
behind the number like this -1/tmp/ (no space).
Additionally there is the -I (Info) option to get some infos about the dvd and 
the output dir.

Release-Notes for 0.3.0 (22-1-2002):
OK. The standard program call has been simplified to a simple "vobcopy". This 
will write the first title from the mounted dvd to the directory you called 
vobcopy from. Also large file support has been added for systems that support
it. "vobcopy -l" will write to files larger than 2 GB. For the other new 
options look into the README or call "vobcopy -h"

Release-Notes for 0.2.0 (5-1-2002):
This release now has the -o option to specify the output directory after 
(-o /tmp for instance). In conjunction with this the title-vob number has now 
to be specified behind -n. And hey, these options can be arranged how you like
 ;-)

Release-Notes for 0.1.1:
Since the 0.1.0 seems to work pretty good this one here only includes a
Makefile and a new text file alternative_programs.txt that lists "rivalling"
programs ;-) 

Release-Notes for 0.1.0:
This one works ;-)
Now check if enough free disk space on destination drive (the directory from
which vobcopy is invoked) is performed and the size of the copied parts are 
matched against the combined size of the title-vobs on dvd.
Also a progression indicator is included and the copied size and vob-size
are outputted.
So, what more do you need? For me it's enough like this so, if you do not
have some really useful feature that needs to be added, that's it from me
for now. Enjoy it and try the new mencoder (from www.mplayerhq.hu), it's really
great.
