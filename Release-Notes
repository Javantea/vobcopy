Release-Notes for 0.5.14-rc1 (Son Okt 24 04:00:41 CEST 2004):

Takeshi Nakamura provided quite some patches to get parts of vobcopy to work
better with openbsd, freebsd and solaris. From him I also learned about
netbsd patches from the netbsd folks I incorporated. I dunno what else,
sorry, forgot...
